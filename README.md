# COCO-json-annotations-to-YOLO-txt-format-converter
This code is for converting COCO json annotations to YOLO txt format (which both are common in object detection projects).\
note: this is specially written for [anylabeling](https://github.com/vietanhdev/anylabeling) annontator tools whose output labels are currently in json format only!

# How to use:
- change ```input_path``` and ```output_path``` to desired directories
- change ```category_to_id``` according your dataset
